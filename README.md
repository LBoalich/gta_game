# Grand Theft Auto Text Based Game

---

## Description
This project was created to complete a Codecademy portfolio project for the Computer Science career path.  It uses python to make a text based grand theft auto game based on characters from the NoPixel roleplay server.  Users create their own character.  They then decide if they want to go racing or rob a bank.  If a player runs out of money, the game ends.

## Features
*  __Entertaining__:  Each pre-built character has their own charisma, strengths, and weaknesses.  These will be most evident if you accidentally type in the wrong prompt or challenge one to a race.   

*  __Easy to use__: Users simply follow the prompts and type in their responses to play the game.  There are built in checks to make sure the user types the proper commands so that they do not get stuck.

## Improvements and Additions
This was the very first project I ever made.  So naturally there are some improvements that could be made.  

* Currently the outcomes of racing or robbing a bank rest solely on the players ability level and chance.  I would like to add a feature that requires input from the user, possibly having them choose a number.  Then using their choice along with the current setup to determine the outcome.

* I would like to work on the rob function and break into smaller functions.  

* There are multiple if statements that could be changed into switch cases.  I believe this would improve readability.

* There are three hack bank methods used in the Hacking Laptop class that could be combined into one method to reduce redundancies.

* Add formatting so that text is easier to read.
